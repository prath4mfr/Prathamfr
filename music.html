But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'
And leave you with nothin'

While the others talked
We were listenin' to Lover's Rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer

But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along

Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'
And leave you with nothin'

But you offered me a kiss. Why?
Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you
