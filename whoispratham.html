    A long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away...

    There lived a curious soul named Pratham.

    As of today, he has existed for approximately 519,837,600 seconds, which in Earth terms means he's definitely old enough to know better, but still young enough to do it anyway.

    Born in the ever-buzzing heart of Delhi, Pratham decided one day — out of sheer boredom and an undeniable urge to flex his web skills — to create a website. Why? Because he could.

    But there's more to him than just HTML and existential time calculations.

    He claims to have massive connections — the kind that stretch across dimensions.

    He's had chai with Modi, handshake deals with Trump, arm-wrestled Putin, and taken late-night drives with Batman (the Batmobile has great bass, by the way).

    And somehow, in all of this, he's still besties with Hello Kitty.

    Whether it's fact or fiction, truth or troll — one thing's clear:

    This is Pratham’s universe.

    And we’re all just browsing in it.

    And yet... people ask — who is Pratham?
